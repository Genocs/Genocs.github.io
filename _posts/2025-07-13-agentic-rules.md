## Agentic Rules

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

The repository is currently empty. Once code is added, this file should be updated to include:

## Developer Commands
- Build commands
- Test commands
- Lint/format commands
- Development server commands

## Architecture Overview

- Project structure and organization
- Key Design patterns and conversions
- Important modules and their relationships
- Configuration and setup requirements

## Notes

Update this file as the codebase evolves to help future Claude Code instances understand the project structure and development workflow.

## Tasks

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and then write a plan.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made.
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
